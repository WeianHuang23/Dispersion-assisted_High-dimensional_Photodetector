# Dispersion-assisted_High-dimensional_Photodetector
This repository contains three `.m` files, primarily utilized for generating the initial data of **polarization, spectrum, and high-dimensional light fields**. Specifically, `theory_polarization.m` corresponds to polarization, `theory_spectrum.m` corresponds to the spectrum, and `theory_high.m` corresponds to the high-dimensional light field.
